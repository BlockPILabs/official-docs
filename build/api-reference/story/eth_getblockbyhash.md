# eth\_getBlockByHash

#### **Parameters:**

**DATA , 32 Bytes** - Hash of a block.

**Boolean** - If true it returns the full transaction objects, if false only the hashes of the transactions.

#### **Returns:**

Object - A block object, or null when no block was found:

* **number: QUANTITY** - the block number.
* **hash: DATA, 32 Bytes** - hash of the block.
* **parentHash: DATA, 32 Bytes** - hash of the parent block.
* **nonce: DATA, 8 Bytes** - hash of the generated proof-of-work.
* **sha3Uncles: DATA, 32 Bytes** - SHA3 of the uncles data in the block.
* **logsBloom: DATA, 256 Bytes** - the bloom filter for the logs of the block.
* **transactionsRoot: DATA, 32 Bytes** - the root of the transaction trie of the block.
* **stateRoot: DATA, 32 Bytes** - the root of the final state trie of the block.
* **receiptsRoot: DATA, 32 Bytes** - the root of the receipts trie of the block.
* **miner: DATA, 20 Bytes** - the address of the beneficiary to whom the mining rewards were given.
* **difficulty: QUANTITY** - integer of the difficulty for this block.
* **totalDifficulty: QUANTITY** - integer of the total difficulty of the chain until this block.
* **extraData: DATA** - the “extra data” field of this block.
* **size: QUANTITY** - integer the size of this block in bytes.
* **gasLimit: QUANTITY** - the maximum gas allowed in this block.
* **gasUsed: QUANTITY** - the total used gas by all transactions in this block.
* **timestamp: QUANTITY** - the unix timestamp for when the block was collated.
* **transactions: Array** - Array of transaction objects, or 32 Bytes transaction hashes depending on the last given parameter.
* **uncles: Array** - Array of uncle hashes.
