# Submit transaction

This endpoint accepts transaction submissions in two formats.

To submit a transaction as JSON, you must submit a SubmitTransactionRequest. To build this request, do the following:

1. Encode the transaction as BCS. If you are using a language that has

native BCS support, make sure of that library. If not, you may take advantage of /transactions/encode\_submission. When using this endpoint, make sure you trust the node you're talking to, as it is possible they could manipulate your request. 2. Sign the encoded transaction and use it to create a TransactionSignature. 3. Submit the request. Make sure to use the "application/json" Content-Type.

To submit a transaction as BCS, you must submit a SignedTransaction encoded as BCS. See SignedTransaction in types/src/transaction/mod.rs. Make sure to use the `application/x.aptos.signed_transaction+bcs` Content-Type.
