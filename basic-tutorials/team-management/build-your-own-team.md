# Build your own Team

## Create a team

{% hint style="info" %}
Once a Team is established, your account will automatically become a Team account, and you can send invitations to UID or email addresses to become your team members. Your team members can view and use all of your endpoints.
{% endhint %}

Once an invitation is sent, there will be a pending member on the list. After the member accept the invitation in his email, the status will  be updated.&#x20;

## Manage team

On the left, there will be a tab called 'Manage team.'

* &#x20;'Member info' allows you to view member information.
* &#x20;'Operation log' lets you see all members' operation records.
* The '+Add member' button adds team members.

At this point, in the Endpoint tab, you are viewing the team's endpoint list.&#x20;

Just like the team owner, you can see the newly added 'Manage team' tab on the left and use other team features. The only difference is that only the team owner can add or remove members, while team members can choose to leave the team.

## Select login method

If you accept an team invitation, there will be multiple options at login. You can choose to log in to your personal account or the team.
