# Payment Method

Currently, users are able to use either wallet balance or directly with a credit card for payment. Whether users are purchasing the package directly or setting up Auto-Renew, both options are available for payment.

If choosing to pay with a credit card, users will be directed to a secondary page same to the "[Deposit with credit card](deposit.md)" page.
